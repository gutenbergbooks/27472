<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<hr class='mini' />

<p>M. Bédollière&#8217;s charming story of Mother
Michel and her cat was turned into English for the
entertainment of two small readers at the writer&#8217;s
fireside. Subsequently the translation was fortunate
enough to find a larger audience in the pages of a
popular juvenile magazine. The ingenious and spirited
series of silhouettes with which Mr. Hopkins
has enriched the text is the translator&#8217;s only plea
for presenting in book form so slight a performance
as his own part of the work.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>HOW MOTHER MICHEL MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF<br />HER CAT.</h3>
</div>

<div class='figleft'>
<img src='images/g002.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 200px; height: 232px;' /><br />
</div>

<p>here
lived in Paris, under the
reign of King Louis XV., a very
rich old countess named Yolande
de la Grenouillère. She was a
worthy and charitable lady, who
distributed alms not only to the
poor of her own parish, Saint-Germain-l&#8217;Auxerrois,
but to the unfortunate of other quarters.
Her husband, Roch-Eustache-Jérémie, Count of Grenouillère,
had fallen gloriously at the battle of Fontenoy, on
the 11th of May, 1745. The noble widow had long
mourned for him, and even now at times wept over
his death. Left without children, and almost entirely
alone in the world, she gave herself up to a
strange fancy,&mdash;a fancy, it is true, which in no
manner detracted from her real virtues and admirable
qualities: she had a passion for animals. And
an unhappy passion it was, since all those she had possessed
had died in her arms.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/g003.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 500px; height: 380px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 500px;'>
The Countess distributes Alms.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The first, in date, in her affections had been a
green parrot, which, having been so imprudent as to
eat some parsley, fell a victim to frightful colics. An
indigestion, caused by sweet biscuits, had taken from
Madame de la Grenouillère a pug-dog of the most
brilliant promise. A third favorite, an ape of a very
interesting species, having broken his chain one night,
went clambering over the trees in the garden, where,
during a shower, he caught a cold in the head, which
conducted him to the tomb.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/g004.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 300px; height: 336px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 300px;'>
The Ape fatally exposes himself.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Following these, the Countess had birds of divers
kinds; but some of them had flown away, and the
others had died of the
pip. Cast down by
such continuous disasters,
Madame de la
Grenouillère shed
many tears. Seeing
her inconsolable, the
friends of the Countess
proposed successively
squirrels, learned
canaries, white mice,
cockatoos; but she
would not listen to
them; she even refused
a superb spaniel
who played dominoes,
danced to music, ate salad, and translated Greek.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>"No, no," she said, "I do not want any more animals;
the air of my house is death to them."</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/g006.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 500px; height: 244px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 500px;'>
The Boys after the Cat.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>She had ended by believing in fatality.</p>
<p>One day, as the Countess was leaving the church,
she saw a crowd of boys hustling and elbowing each
other, and giving vent to peals of joyous laughter.
When, seated in her carriage, she was able to overlook
the throng, she discovered that the cause of this
tumult was a poor cat to whose tail the little wretches
had tied a tin saucepan.</p>
<p>The unfortunate cat had evidently been running
a long time, for he seemed overcome with fatigue.
Seeing that he slackened his speed, his tormentors
formed a circle around him, and began pelting him
with stones. The luckless creature bowed his head,
and, recognizing that he was surrounded by none but
enemies, resigned himself to his hard fate with the
heroism of a Roman senator. Several stones had already
reached him, when Madame de la Grenouillère,
seized with deep compassion, descended from her carriage,
and, pushing the crowd aside, exclaimed: "I
will give a louis to whoever will save that animal!"</p>
<p>These words produced a magical effect; they transformed
the persecutors into liberators; the poor cat
came near being suffocated by those who now disputed
the honor of rescuing him safe and sound.
Finally, a sort of young Hercules overthrew his rivals,
brought off the cat, and presented it half dead to the
Countess.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/g007.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 500px; height: 279px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 500px;'>
The Luckless Creature bowed his Head.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>"Very well," she said; "here, my brave little
man, is the reward I promised." She gave him a
bright golden louis just out of the mint, and then
added, "Relieve this poor animal of his inconvenient
burden."</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/g008.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 500px; height: 342px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 500px;'>
"Dear me, how homely he is!"<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>While the young Hercules obeyed, Madame de la
Grenouillère regarded the creature she had rescued.
It was a true type of the street-cat. His natural
hideousness was increased by the accidents of a long
and irregular career; his short hair was soiled with
mud; one could scarcely distinguish beneath the various
splashes his gray fur robe striped with black.
He was so thin as to be nearly transparent, so
shrunken that one could count his ribs, and so dispirited
that a mouse might have beaten him. There
was only one thing in his favor, and that was his
physiognomy.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/g009.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 500px; height: 284px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 500px;'>
The Cat is presented, half dead, to the Countess.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>"Dear me, how homely he is!" said Madame de la
Grenouillère, after finishing her examination.</p>
<p>At the moment she stepped into the carriage, the
cat fixed his great sea-green eyes upon her and gave
her a look, strange, indefinable, full at the same time
of gratitude and reproach, and so expressive that the
good lady was instantly fascinated. She read in this
glance a discourse of great eloquence. The look
seemed to wish to say,&mdash;</p>
<p>"You have obeyed a generous impulse; you saw
me feeble, suffering, oppressed, and you took pity on
me. Now that your benevolence is satisfied, my deformity
inspires you with contempt. I thought you
were good, but you are not good; you have the instinct
of kindness, but you are not kind. If you
were really charitable you would continue to interest
yourself in me for the very reason that I am homely;
you would reflect that my misfortunes are owing to
my ugly appearance, and that the same cause,&mdash;should
you leave me there in the street, at the mercy
of the wicked boys,&mdash;the same cause, I say, would
produce the same effects. Go! you needn&#8217;t pride
yourself on your half-way benevolence!&mdash;you have
not done me a service; you have only prolonged my
agony. I am an outcast, the whole world is against
me, I am condemned to die; let my destiny be accomplished!"</p>
<p>Madame de la Grenouillère was moved to tears.
The cat seemed to her superhuman&mdash;no, it was a
cat; it seemed to her superanimal! She thought of
the mysteries of transformation, and imagined that
the cat, before assuming his present form, had been
a great orator and a person of standing. She said to
her maid, Mother Michel, who was in the carriage,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Take the cat and carry him."</p>
<p>"What, you will bring him with you, madame?"
cried Mother Michel.</p>
<p>"Certainly. As long as I live that animal shall
have a place at my fireside and at my table. If you
wish to please me, you will treat him with the same
zeal and affection you show to myself."</p>
<p>"Madame shall be obeyed."</p>
<p>"That is well,&mdash;and now for home!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>HOW THE CAT WAS INSTALLED WITH MADAME DE LA<br />GRENOUILLÈRE, AND CONFIDED TO THE CARE OF<br />MOTHER MICHEL.</h3>
</div>

<div class='figleft'>
<img src='images/g011.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 200px; height: 310px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 200px;'>
Mother Michel.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Madame de la Grenouillère inhabited a magnificent
mansion situated on the corner of the streets
Saint-Thomas-du-Louvre and Orties-Saint-Louis;
there she led a very retired
life, on almost intimate terms with
her two principal domestics,&mdash;Madame
Michel, her maid and companion, and
M. Lustucru, the steward. These servants
being elderly persons, the Countess,
who was possessed of a pleasant humor,
had christened them Mother Michel and
Father Lustucru.</p>
<p>The features of Mother Michel bore
the imprint of her amiable disposition;
she was as open and candid as Father
Lustucru was sly and dissimulating.
The plausible air of the steward might
deceive persons without much experience; but close
observers could easily discover the most perverse inclinations
under his false mask of good nature. There
was duplicity in his great blue eyes, anger concentrated
in his nostrils, something wily in the end of
his tapering nose, and malice in the shape of his
lips.</p>
<p>However, this man had never, in appearance, at
least, done anything to forfeit his honor; he had been
able to guard an outside air of honesty, hiding very
carefully the blackness of his nature. His wickedness
was like a mine to which
one has not yet applied the
match,&mdash;it waited only for
an occasion to flash out.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/g012.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 200px; height: 254px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 200px;'>
Father Lustucru.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Lustucru detested animals,
but, in order to flatter
the taste of his mistress, he
pretended to idolize them.
On seeing Mother Michel
bearing in her arms the rescued
cat, he said to himself:</p>
<p>"What, another beast!
As if there were not enough
of us in the house!"</p>
<p>He could not help throwing a glance of antipathy
at the new-comer; then, curbing himself quickly, he
cried, with an affected admiration,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Oh, the beautiful cat! the pretty cat! that cat
hasn&#8217;t his equal!"&mdash;and he caressed it in the most
perfidious fashion.</p>
<p>"Truly?" said Madame de la Grenouillère; "you
do not find him too homely?"</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/g013.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 500px; height: 486px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 500px;'>
"Oh, the Beautiful Cat!"<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>"Too homely! But, then, he has charming eyes.
But, if he was frightful, your interesting yourself in
him would change him."</p>
<p>"He displeased me at first."</p>
<p> "The beings who displease at first are those one
loves the most after awhile," replied Father Lustucru,
sententiously.</p>
<p>They proceeded at once to make the toilet of the
cat, who, in spite of his instinctive horror of water,
submitted with touching resignation to being washed;
he seemed to understand that it improved his personal
appearance. After giving him a dish of broken
meat, which he ate with great relish, they arranged
the hours for his meals, the employment of his days,
and the place where he was to sleep.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/g014.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 500px; height: 284px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 500px;'>
The Cat is washed.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>They thought also to give him a name. Mother
Michel and Father Lustucru proposed several that
were quite happy, such as Mistigris, Tristepatte, etc.;
but the Countess rejected them all successively. She
desired a name that would recall the circumstances in
which the cat was found. An old scholar, whom she
consulted the next day, suggested that of Moumouth,
composed of two Hebrew words which signify <i>saved
from saucepans</i>.</p>

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 200px;'>
The Old Scholar looks for a Name.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>At the end of a few days, Moumouth was unrecognizable.
His fur was polished with care; nourishing
food had filled
out his form;
his mustaches
stood up like
those of a
swordsman of
the seventeenth century; his eyes
shone as emeralds. He was a living
proof of the influence of good
fare upon the race. He owed his
excellent condition chiefly to
Mother Michel, whom he held in
affectionate consideration; he
showed, on the other hand, for Father Lustucru a
very marked dislike. As if he had divined that here
he had to do with an enemy, he refused to accept
anything presented by the steward. However, they
saw but little of each other. The days passed very
happily with Moumouth, and everything promised a
smiling future for him; but, like the sword of Damocles,
troubles are ever suspended above the heads
of men and of cats. On the 24th of January, 1753,
an unusual sadness was observed in Moumouth;
he scarcely responded to the caresses which Madame
de la Grenouillère lavished upon him; he ate nothing,
and spent the day crouched on a corner of the
hearth, gazing mournfully into the fire. He had a
presentiment of some misfortune, and the misfortune
came.</p>

<p>That night a messenger, sent from the Château de
la Gingeole in Normandy, brought a letter to the
Countess from her younger sister, who, having broken
a leg in getting out of her carriage, begged the
Countess, her only relative, to come to her at once.
Madame de la Grenouillère was too sympathetic and
kind-hearted to hesitate an instant.</p>
<p>"I depart to-morrow," said she.</p>
<p>At these words, Moumouth, who followed his benefactress
with his
eyes, gave a melancholy
<i>miau</i>.</p>

<p>"Poor cat!"
resumed the lady,
with emotion, "it
is necessary that we should
be separated! I cannot bring
you with me, for my sister
has the weakness to hate animals
of your species; she pretends they are treacherous.
What slander! In her youth she caressed
a kitten, who, too much excited by marks of affection,
scratched her involuntarily. Was it from wickedness?
No, it was from sensibility. However, since
that day my sister has sworn an eternal hatred for
cats."</p>
<p>Moumouth regarded his mistress with an air which
seemed to say,&mdash;</p>
<p>"But you, at least, you do us justice, truly superior
woman!"</p>
<p>After a moment of silence and meditation, the
Countess added,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Mother Michel, I confide my cat to you."</p>
<p>"We will take good care of him, madame," said
Father Lustucru.</p>
<p>"Don&#8217;t you trouble yourself about him, I pray
you," interrupted the Countess. "You know that
he has taken a dislike to you; your presence merely
is sufficient to irritate him. Why, I don&#8217;t know; but
you are insupportable to him."</p>
<p>"That is true," said Father Lustucru, with contrition;
"but the cat is unjust, for I love him and he
doesn&#8217;t love me."</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/g021.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 500px; height: 265px;' /><br />

"Mother Michel, I confide my Cat to you."<br />
</p>

<p>"My sister is also unjust. Cats, perhaps, love her,
and she does not love them. I respect her opinion.
Respect that of Moumouth." Having pronounced
these words in a firm tone, Madame de la Grenouillère
addressed herself to Mother Michel.</p>
<p>"It is to you, Mother Michel, and to you alone,
that I confide him. Return him to me safe and
sound, and I will cover you with benefits. I am
sixty-five years of age, you are ten years younger;
it is probable that you will live to close my eyes"&mdash;</p>
<p>"Ah, madame! why such sorrowful ideas?"</p>
<p>"Let me finish. To guard against mischance, I
have already thought to provide for you comfortably;
but, if you keep Moumouth for me, I will give you
a pension of fifteen hundred livres."</p>
<p>"Ah, madame!" said Mother Michel, in an impressive
tone, "it is not necessary to hire my services;
I love the cat with all my heart, and I will always be
devoted to him."</p>
<p>"I am sure of it, and I shall also know how to reward
your zeal." During this conversation, Father
Lustucru employed all his forces to conceal the expression
of his jealousy.</p>
<p>"Everything for her, and nothing for me!" he
said to himself. "Fifteen hundred livres a year! It
is a fortune, and she will have it! Oh, no! she shall
not have it."</p>

The Post-chaise is ready.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The next morning, at half-past seven, four lively
horses were harnessed to the post-chaise which was
to convey the excellent old lady to Normandy. She
said a last adieu to her favorite, pressed him to her
heart, and stepped into the carriage.</p>
<p>Until then, Moumouth had felt only a vague uneasiness;
but at this moment he understood it all!
He saw his benefactress ready to depart; and, trembling
at the thought of losing her, he made one bound
to her side.</p>
<p>"It is necessary for you to stay here," said Madame
de la Grenouillère, making an effort to restrain
her tears.</p>
<p>Will it be believed?&mdash;the cat also wept!</p>

<p>To put an end to this painful scene, Mother Michel
seized the cat by
the shoulders and
detached him from
the carriage-cushion,
to which he
clung; the door
closed, the horses
gave a vigorous
pull, and started
off at a speed of not less than three leagues an hour.
Moumouth rolled in a convulsion,
and then fainted.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>IN WHICH ARE SHOWN THE GOODNESS OF MOTHER<br />MICHEL AND THE WICKEDNESS OF FATHER<br />LUSTUCRU.</h3>

<p>other
Michel, worthy of the
confidence which had been reposed
in her, displayed for Moumouth
a truly maternal tenderness;
she tended him, coddled
him, took such pains with him, in short, that he
became one of the most beautiful cats in that quarter
of the town where the cats are magnificent. She
watched over him constantly, gave him the choicest
bits to eat, and put him to bed at night on the softest
of eider-down quilts.</p>
<p>Fearing that he might fall ill some day, and wishing
to inform herself concerning the maladies to
which cats are liable, she procured various books on
that important subject; she even went so far in her
devotion as to read the "History of Cats," by François-Auguste
Paradis de Moncrif, a member of the
French Academy.</p>
<p>The conduct of Mother Michel had no low motive
of personal interest. She gave scarcely a thought to
herself, the good old soul! Content with little, she
would always have enough to live on; she required
nothing but a small room, brown bread, a supply
of wood in winter, and a spinning-wheel. But
she had nephews and nieces, god-children, whom
she hoped to be able to help; it was to them that
she destined in advance the gifts of Madame de la
Grenouillère.</p>
<p>The continually increasing prosperity of Moumouth
exasperated Father Lustucru. He saw with a sort
of dread the approach of the hour when the faithful
guardian would be rewarded; he dreamt day and
night of the means to prevent it,&mdash;to carry off her
four-footed pupil, and bring down on her the wrath
of their mistress. By dint of indulging his hatred
and envy in solitary reflections, he ceased at last to
draw back at the prospect of committing a crime.</p>
<p>"How," he said, "how rid the house of that miserable
cat? What arms shall I use against him?
Fire, poison, or water? I will try water!"</p>
<p>This resolution taken, he thought of nothing but
to put it into execution. It was difficult to get possession
of Moumouth, of whom Mother Michel rarely
lost sight; and Moumouth, too, not having the slightest
confidence in the steward, was always on the defensive.
Lustucru watched during several days for
a favorable occasion.</p>
<p>One night, after making an excellent supper, Moumouth
curled himself up near the fire in the parlor,
at the feet of Mother Michel, and slept the sleep of
the just with good digestion. In the midst of this,
Father Lustucru came into the room.</p>
<p>"Good!" he thought. "The cat sleeps. Let us
get the guardian out of the way."</p>
<p>"How amiable of you to come and keep me company!"
said Mother Michel, politely. "You are
quite well this evening?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly; but everybody
is not like me. Our
porter, for example,
is in
a deplorable
state; he is
suffering excessively
from
his rheumatism,
and
would be very happy to see you a moment. You
have gentle words to console
the afflicted, and excellent receipts
to cure them. Go, then,
and pay a little visit to our
friend Krautman; I am persuaded
that your presence will
help him."</p>

<p>Mother Michel got up at once and descended to
the apartment of the porter, who was, indeed, suffering
from a violent rheumatic pain.</p>
<p>"Now for us two!" cried Father Lustucru to himself.</p>

The Steward seizes Moumouth.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>He went stealthily into an adjoining room, walking
upon the tips of his toes, and took a covered basket
which he had hidden in the bottom of a closet.
Then he returned
to Moumouth,
whom
he seized
roughly by the
neck. The
unfortunate
animal awoke
with a start,
and found himself
suspended
in the air face
to face with
Father Lustucru,
his enemy.
In that horrible situation he would have cried, and
struggled, and called for assistance, but he had no
time. The odious steward plunged the poor cat into
the basket, quickly clapped down the solid cover, and
ran rapidly to the staircase, his eyes haggard and his
hair standing on end, like a man who commits a
crime.</p>

The Cat is plunged into the Basket.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>It was a beautiful night in February, with a clear
sky and a dry, cold atmosphere. The moon shone
with all her brightness; but, at intervals, great clouds
drifted over
her face and
rendered the obscurity
complete.
Father
Lustucru was
obliged to cross
the garden, in
order to pass out
by a small door,
of which he had taken the key. He glided from bush
to bush, carefully avoiding the
paths, except when the clouds veiled
the moon. He had half-opened the
door, when he heard a sound of
footsteps and voices outside. He
started back
involuntarily,
then stood still and listened.</p>

</p>

<p>"What foolishness!" he said,
after a moment of silent observation.
"I had forgotten that
it was carnival-time; those are
masqueraders passing."</p>

He dances with Delight.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>It was, in effect, a band of
masqueraders from the Palais Royal. Lustucru
waited until they were gone; then he hurried out.
When he reached the quay, in the joy of success, he
began to whistle a dancing-tune and
cut capers; his transports resembled
those of a cannibal who dances
around his victim.</p>

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 100px;'>
The Cat is thrown into the River.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>He went up the Seine as far as the
bridge of Notre Dame, in the middle
of which he halted, and holding the
basket over the parapet, turned it
suddenly upside down, and launched
the luckless Moumouth into the icy
waters of the river. The cat, in
dropping through space, gave a cry
that seemed to come from a human
voice. The assassin shuddered, but
his emotion did not last long. He
thrust his hands into his pockets
and said, in a tone of bitter mockery,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Pleasant voyage to you, dear
Moumouth; endeavor to arrive all
right! By the way," added he, "I
think cats know how to swim; that
brigand is capable of getting himself
out of this business. Bah! it is a
long distance from the bridge of
Notre Dame to Saint-Thomas-du-Louvre!"</p>
<p>Reassured by this reflection, Lustucru
continued on his way home, re-entered
by the door of the garden, climbed cautiously
up to his room, and held himself in readiness to enjoy
the lamentations of Mother Michel.</p>
<p>Mother Michel was detained some time by the
porter; finally, she left him, to give her cat the cup
of milk and sugar with which she regaled him every
night.</p>
<p>She ascended to the parlor with measured steps,
calmly, not anticipating any catastrophe. Failing to
see Moumouth in the place he had occupied, she simply
believed that he had smuggled himself behind the
cushions of the sofa. She looked there, and beneath
the sofa, and searched under the other pieces of furniture.
Then, running to the staircase, she called:
"Moumouth! Moumouth!"</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

</p>
</div>

<p>"He doesn&#8217;t answer me," said she. "But when
I went down-stairs, Lustucru was here; may be he
can tell me what has become of the cat."</p>
<p>She knocked without delay at the door of the
steward, who pretended to rouse himself from a deep
slumber, and, in a gruff voice, demanded what was
wanted.</p>
<p>"Isn&#8217;t Moumouth with you?"</p>
<p>"Does your cat ever come where I am? You
know very well that he can&#8217;t bear me."</p>
<p>"Alas! where
is he? I left
him in the parlor,
near the
fire, and I cannot
find him."</p>

</p>

<p>"Can he be
lost?" said
Father Lustucru, feigning the most lively anxiety.</p>
<p>"Lost! Oh, no, it is impossible! He is somewhere
in the house."</p>
<p>"He ought to be found," said the villain, gravely.
"He ought to be searched for this very instant.
Moumouth is a precious animal, whose merit makes
it well worth while to wake up the servants."</p>
<p>All the inmates of the house were soon on foot,
each armed with a candle. They ransacked the
nooks and corners, from the cellar to the garret, from
the court to the garden. Lustucru directed the
operations with apparent zeal. After ineffectual
searches, Mother Michel, exhausted by emotion and
fatigue, threw herself helplessly into an arm-chair.</p>

<p>"Alas!" said she, "I left him only an instant, and
it was to do a good action."</p>
<p>"I begin to believe that your cat is really lost,"
replied Lustucru, in a severe tone. "It is a great
misfortune for you! What will Madame de la Grenouillère
say when she comes back? She is capable
of turning you out of doors!"</p>

<p>"Turn me out of doors!" cried Mother Michel,
suddenly drawing
herself up
to her full
height. Then
she sunk down
again, her face
grew pallid, her
eyes closed, and
she fell back
without consciousness.</p>
<p>Father Lustucru
regarded her with a dry eye, and without feeling
the slightest remorse. He laughed, the infamous
man!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>IN WHICH THE CAT DISPLAYS INTELLIGENCE BEYOND<br />HIS STATION IN LIFE, AND BEHAVES HANDSOMELY<br />IN ADVERSITY.</h3>

<p>e
lost sight of Moumouth at the
moment when, precipitated from
the parapet of the bridge of Notre
Dame, he found himself struggling
in the water.</p>
<p>Luckily for him, the piles of
the principal arch had a wide ledge, to which he was
able to attach himself. From this place he cast a
glance around him. The Seine appeared to him a
boundless ocean, which it was beyond his strength
to cross; rather than attempt to reach the shores
that seemed to recede before him, he prepared to
stay where he was, at the risk of perishing with
hunger or cold, or being swept away by a wave.
He mewed at first in sign of distress, but very soon,
believing himself hopelessly lost, he judged it useless
to tire his lungs, and awaited the end with a resignation
which formed the basis of his character.</p>
<p>Toward five o&#8217;clock in the morning, two gentlemen
from the island of Saint-Louis,&mdash;two very skillful
amateur fishermen,&mdash;came to throw their lines from
the top of the bridge of Notre Dame.</p>
<p>"You are early, neighbor Guignolet," said the person
who arrived last; "it appears that we have both
had the same idea."</p>
<p>"And we have done well, neighbor Groquemouche;
there was a rise in the river last night, great numbers
of fish have descended from the upper Seine, and one
will have to be dreadfully awkward not to take
them."</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/g039.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 300px; height: 252px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 300px;'>
"Agreed!" said M. Guignolet.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>"Will you enter into an agreement, neighbor
Guignolet? Let us fish in partnership, divide the
catch, and dine together to-day."</p>
<p>"Agreed!" said M. Guignolet, and as each held
his line in his
right hand, they
clasped their left
hands together
in token of the
treaty.</p>
<p>On seeing the
two cords descend
Moumouth
conceived some
hope. As soon
as they were within his reach he grappled them, and
the fishermen, feeling the unusual weight, cried out
with one voice, "A bite! a bite!" and hastened to
haul in their lines.</p>

<p>"I bet I have caught a wattle," said M. Guignolet,
regretting that he couldn&#8217;t rub his hands together
to testify his satisfaction.</p>
<p>"I must have an immense carp," replied M. Groquemouche.
He had scarcely
finished the sentence
when Moumouth leaped
over the parapet.</p>
<p>"Treason!" cried the two
fishers, who started in pursuit
of the quadruped that
had come so miraculously
out of the water; but Moumouth
ran faster than they
did and easily escaped them.</p>

Moumouth grapples the Lines.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>When he was alone, he
took breath, examined the
houses, and, not finding
one that resembled his, naturally
concluded that it was not there. It was necessary,
however, to find shelter; shivering with cold
and panting with his exertions, he could not remain
a moment longer in the street without exposing himself
to an inflammation of the chest. Guided by a
light, he made his way into the basement of a baker&#8217;s
shop, and, hiding himself behind a pile of bread-baskets,
went quietly to sleep.</p>
<p>He was awakened by hunger.</p>
<p>Moumouth was born of poor parents who had
abandoned him in his earliest infancy; he had been
brought up in the streets, obliged to procure his own
living, and trained in the school of adversity. Thus
he was very skillful in the art of catching rats and
mice,&mdash;a useful art, too often
neglected by cats belonging
to the first families.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

The Imprudent Mouse.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>He placed himself on the
watch, and surprised a mouse
that had stolen out of its
hole to eat some flour. He
dropped upon the imprudent
mouse, in describing what is called in geometry a
parabola, and seized it by the nose, to prevent it
from crying out. This feat, although performed
with address and in silence, attracted the attention of
the baker&#8217;s boy. "Hi!
a cat!" cried the apprentice,
arming himself
with a scoop.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/g043.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 300px; height: 169px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 300px;'>
"Don&#8217;t hurt him!" said the Baker.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The&nbsp;master-baker
turned his eyes towards
Moumouth,
saw him devouring
the mouse, and said to the boy:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Don&#8217;t hurt him; he is doing us a service."</p>
<p>"But where did he come from?"</p>
<p>"What does that matter, provided he is useful
here?" answered the baker, who was a man of intelligence.
"Eat, eat, my friend," he continued,
stooping down to gently caress Moumouth; "eat as
many mice as possible, there will always be enough
left."</p>
<p>Our cat profited by the permission accorded to him,
and, having satisfied his hunger, had a desire to set
out in search of the mansion of Madame de la Grenouillère;
but the baker barred the passage.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

Moumouth jumps out of the Window.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>"Wait a minute!" he said. "I wanted a good
cat; Heaven sent me one, and I shall not forgive
myself if I let him escape. Hulloo! Jacques, shut
up all the openings, and if this rogue makes a show
of running off, give him three or four smart blows
with the broom."</p>
<p>Thus the host of Moumouth became his tyrant; so
true is it that personal interest
depraves the best natures. Our
cat, as if comprehending what
was passing, leaped without
hesitation upon the shoulders
of the baker&#8217;s boy, and thence
into the street.</p>

All the Street Dogs pursue Moumouth.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>There a new danger awaited
him. Surprised by this unexpected
apparition, an enormous
bull-dog planted himself directly
in front of Moumouth. Moumouth had a lively desire
to avoid an unequal contest, but the dog kept
an eye on him, and did not lose one of his movements,
going to the right when Moumouth went to
the left, and to the left when Moumouth moved to
the right, and growled all the while in a malicious
fashion. For an instant they stood
motionless, observing each other,&mdash;the
dog with paws extended, teeth displayed,
and body drawn
back, and the cat
with open mouth,
his back arched
and his head
thrust forward.</p>

<p>Neither seemed

upon his adversary, who avoided him adroitly, passed
underneath him, and fled in the direction of the
quay, the bull-dog giving chase. Away they went,
darting among the crowd of pedestrians and in and
out between the carriages. In a natural spirit of
imitation, the wandering dogs that encountered them
running joined in the race, and at the end of a minute
Moumouth had more than thirty-seven dogs in
pursuit of him.</p>
<p>"I am lost," he says to himself, "but at least I
shall sell my life dearly."</p>

he faces his numerous enemies with so terrible an
eye that they recoil like a single man. Profiting by
their hesitation, he
turns suddenly and
scrambles to the
top of the wall.
He is soon beyond
the reach of the
dogs, but he is not
yet in safety; if
he makes a false
step, if his strength
gives out, if the
plaster crumbles
under his claws,
twenty yawning
mouths, hungry for
slaughter, are there to tear him to pieces!</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, Mother Michel had passed the
night in lamentation. She
could not control her grief, for
the loss of Moumouth; she
called him continually in a
plaintive voice, and&mdash;if we
may credit the popular song&mdash;the
neighbors heard her cry at
the window: "Who will bring him back to me?"</p>

<p>The next morning, at the rising of the smiling sun,
the perfidious Lustucru presented himself before
Mother Michel in order to say to her:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Well, my dear companion, have you found him?"</p>
<p>"Alas, no!" she murmured. "Have you any
news of him?"</p>
<p>"Nothing positive," replied the steward, who
wished to torment
the poor
woman; "but
I dreamed of
him all night
long; he appeared
to me
in a dream,
with his face
pale and an exhausted air, like a cat who did not feel
very well."</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>"In what place was he?"</p>
<p>"He seemed to be in a garden, at the foot of a
lilac-bush."</p>
<p>Mother Michel instantly ran to the garden, where,
as you may imagine, she did not find Moumouth.</p>
<p>During the whole day Lustucru amused himself
by giving her false exultations, which were followed
by increased despondency.</p>
<p>"Mother Michel," said he, "just now, in passing
the store-room, I thought I heard a kind of meyowing."</p>
<p>Mother Michel hastened to visit the store-room.</p>
<p>Presently he came to her out of breath, and said:&mdash;</p>

Illustration: Mother Michel encounters nothing but Rats.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>"We have him at last! I am nearly certain that
he is rummaging in the cellar."</p>
<p>And Mother Michel ventured
into the gloomy vaults of the
cellar, where she encountered
nothing but rats.</p>
<p>It was near the close of the
day that Lustucru pronounced
these words, which a popular song
has happily preserved for us:&mdash;</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>"Oh, Mother Michel,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Your cat is not lost;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>He is up in the garret</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>A-hunting the rats,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>With his little straw gun</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>And his sabre of wood!"</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>The words were full of a bitter raillery, which
Father Lustucru was unable to disguise. To pretend
that Moumouth was hunting rats with his little straw
gun and his wooden sword was to suppose something
quite unlikely, for nobody ever saw a cat make use
of such arms. But the agonies of Mother Michel
had so confused her mind, that she noticed only what
could give her a gleam of hope.</p>
<p>"He is in the garret!" she cried, without paying
attention to the rest of the verse. "Let us hasten
there, my dear sir; let us search for him. Give me
your arm, for I am so nervous, so troubled, so harassed
by fatigue, that I have not the strength to get
up alone."</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>The two mounted to the garret, and Mother
Michel, lantern in hand, searched in the attic and
under the roof. Silence
and solitude
reigned everywhere.</p>
<p>"You are again
mistaken," murmured
Mother Michel.</p>
<p>"No, no," replied
the malicious man;
"let us continue to hunt, we shall finish by finding.
We haven&#8217;t looked there&mdash;behind those fagots."</p>
<p>The credulous Mother Michel advanced in the
direction indicated, and&mdash;to the great stupefaction
of Lustucru&mdash;the cat, which he believed drowned,
appeared in full health and strength, and fixed its
gaze upon him
indignantly.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/g052.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 300px; height: 185px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 300px;'>
"It is he! It is he!" cried Mother Michel.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>"It is he! it
is he!" cried
Mother Michel,
seizing Moumouth
in her
arms. "Ah, my
dear Lustucru!
my good and true friend, how I thank you for conducting
me here!"</p>
<p>The steward had scarcely any taste for compliments
which he so little merited. Pale-faced and
cold, he hung his head before his victim, whose preservation
he could not explain to himself. It was,
however, a very simple thing: Moumouth, pursued
by the dogs, succeeded in leaping from the wall,
and, passing from gutter to gutter, from garden to
garden, from roof to roof, had reached his domicile;
but, dreading the resentment of his enemy, he had
not dared to appear, and had hidden himself in
the garret.</p>
<p>"Am I the dupe of a nightmare?" said Father
Lustucru to himself. "Is it really that rascal of a
Moumouth that I have there under my eyes, in flesh
and bone? Isn&#8217;t it his ghost that has come back
to torment me? This cat, then, is the evil one in
person!"</p>
<p>The cat was not the evil one&mdash;Providence had
protected him.</p>

</div>

<p>he
events we have recorded
indicate very clearly the
position of our personages.
Fearing to lose both the
well-beloved cat and the
advantages she was ambitious
to obtain, Mother
Michel redoubled her vigilance
and attention.</p>
<p>Moumouth, knowing henceforth with whom he had
to deal, promised himself to avoid the steward, or to
fight him, if need be, with tooth and nail.</p>
<p>As to Father Lustucru, it was enough that his projects
had been defeated, in order that he should persist
in them with desperation. He now wished the
destruction of the poor and innocent cat, not only on
account of his jealousy of Mother Michel, but because
he hated the cat itself.</p>
<p>"Oh, what humiliation!" he said to himself, with
bitterness. "I ought to hide myself, retire to a desert,
and bury me in the bowels of the earth! What!
I, Jérôme Lustucru, a grown man, a man of knowledge
and experience, a man&mdash;I dare say it&mdash;charming
in society, I am vanquished, scoffed at,
taken for a dupe, by a cat of the gutter!... I leave
him at the bottom of a river, and find him at the top
of a house! I wish to separate him from his guardian,
and I am the means of bringing them together!
I lead Mother Michel to the garret
to torture her, and there I witness
her transports of joy! The cat I
believed dead reappears to defy me!...
He shall not defy me long!"</p>
<p>And Father Lustucru remained
absorbed in deep meditation.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/g054.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 200px; height: 222px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 200px;'>
Lustucru meditates.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Moumouth had not yet dined that
day, and he made it plain by expressive miauing
that he would very willingly place something under
his teeth. Presently, Mother Michel said to him&mdash;for
she spoke to him as if he were an intelligent being,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Have patience, sir; we are going to attend to
you."</p>
<p>She descended to the parlor, which she habitually
occupied since the departure of Madame de la Grenouillère,
and the cat, who accompanied Mother
Michel, was clearly displeased at seeing her take the
road to the chamber of Lustucru. Nevertheless, he
went in with her, persuaded that in the presence of
that faithful friend the steward would not dare to
undertake anything against him.</p>
<p>At the moment she knocked at the door, Father
Lustucru was taking from the shelf a green package
which bore this label: <i>Death to Rats</i>.</p>
<p>"This is the
thing," he said to
himself, thrusting
the paper into his
vest. "<i>Death to
Rats</i> should also be
<i>Death to Cats</i>. Our
dear Moumouth
shall make the trial....
What can
one do to serve you,
my good Mother
Michel?"</p>
<p>"It is five o&#8217;clock,
M. Lustucru, and
you forget my cat."</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/g055.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 200px; height: 307px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 200px;'>
The Green Package.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>"I forget him!"
cried the steward,
clasping his hands as
if very much hurt by
the suspicion, "I was just thinking of him.... I
am going to prepare for him such a delicious hash
that he will never want another!"</p>
<p>"Thanks, Monsieur Lustucru! I shall inform
Madame, the Countess, of your care for her favorite.
I have received a letter from her this very day; she
sends me word that she shall return shortly; that she
hopes to find Moumouth in good condition, and that
she has in reserve for me a very handsome reward.
You comprehend my joy, Monsieur Lustucru! My
sister is left a widow with four children, to whom I
hand over my little savings each year. Until now
this assistance has not been much; but, thanks to the
gifts of Madame, the Countess, the poor children will
be able to go to school and learn a trade."</p>
<p>In pronouncing these words the eyes of Mother
Michel were moist and bright with the most sweet
joy,&mdash;that which one experiences in performing or
meditating good actions. The steward, however, was
not affected. He had so given himself up to his evil
passions that they completely mastered him, and had
by degrees stifled all generous sentiments in his soul,
as the tares which one lets grow
choke the good grain.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/g056.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 200px; height: 193px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 200px;'>
"Come, let us go!"<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>One would have said that
Moumouth understood this man.
The cat approached Mother Michel,
who had seated herself to
chat awhile, and looking at her
with supplicating eyes, pulled at the
skirt of her robe, as if to say to her:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Come, let us go!"</p>
<p>"Take care!" said the good creature, "you will
tear my dress."</p>
<p>Moumouth began again.</p>
<p>"What is it? Do you want to get out of here?"
asked Mother Michel.</p>
<p>Moumouth made several affirmative capers in the
air.</p>
<p>"Decidedly," she added, "this cat is not contented
anywhere but in the parlor."</p>
<p>She rose and withdrew, preceded by Moumouth,
who bounded with joy.</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour afterward the steward had
prepared a most appetizing hash composed of the
breast of chicken, the best quality of bread, and other
ingredients justly esteemed by dainty eaters. After
adding a large dose of the "Death to Rats," he set the
hash down in an adjoining
room, and,
opening the parlor
door, cried:</p>
<p>"Monsieur is served!!"</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/g057.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 300px; height: 226px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 300px;'>
Moumouth is pleased to see the Hash.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>On beholding this
delicate dish, Moumouth
thrilled with
pleasure, for, to tell
the truth, he was rather greedy. He stretched his
nose over the plate, and then suddenly retreated,
arching his back. A sickening and infectious odor
had mounted to his nostrils. He made a tour round
the plate, took another sniff, and again retreated.
This animal, full of sagacity, had scented the
poison.</p>
<p>"Well, that is very extraordinary," said
Mother Michel; and, having
vainly offered the food to her
cat, she went to find Lustucru,
to inform him what had occurred.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/g058.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 200px; height: 139px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 200px;'>
He sniffs with Disgust.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The traitor listened with inward rage.</p>
<p>"What!" said he, "he has refused to eat it? It
is probably because he is not hungry."</p>
<p>"So I suppose, Monsieur
Lustucru; for your
hash looks very nice.
I should like it myself, and
I&#8217;ve half a
mind to taste
it, to set Moumouth
an example."
At
this, Father
Lustucru, in
spite of his
hardness,
could not help
trembling. For a minute he was horrified at his
crime, and cried hastily:&mdash;</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/g059.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 300px; height: 266px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 300px;'>
"Don&#8217;t touch it, I beg of you."<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>"Don&#8217;t touch it, I beg of you!"</p>
<p>"Why not? Is there anything wrong in the hash?"</p>
<p>"No, certainly not," stammered Father Lustucru;
"but what has been prepared for a cat should not
serve for a Christian. It is necessary to guard propriety,
and not trifle with the dignity of human nature."</p>
<p>Mother Michel accepted this reasoning, and said, a
little snappishly:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Very well; Moumouth may suit himself! I do not
wish to yield to all his fancies, and I shall not
give him anything else."</p>
<p>The following day the hash was still uneaten.</p>
<p>The steward had hoped that the cat, pressed by
hunger, would have thrown himself upon the poisoned
food; but Moumouth knew how to suffer. He put
up with abstinence, lived on scraps and crumbs of
bread, and recoiled with terror every time that his
guardian offered him the fatal plate,
which finally remained forgotten in
a corner of the closet in the
antechamber.</p>

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 200px;'>
The Fatal Plate remains forgotten.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Father Lustucru, seeing that
his plot had not succeeded, was
more irritable than ever. The
desire to rid himself of Moumouth
became a fixed idea with him, a passion, a
monomania; he dreamed of it day and night. Each
letter in which Madame de la Grenouillère demanded
news of the cat and repeated her promise of recompense
to Mother Michel, each sign of interest given
by the Countess to her two favorites, increased the
blind fury of their enemy. He thought of the most
infernal plans to demolish Moumouth without risk to
himself, but none of them seemed sufficiently safe and
expeditious. Finally he decided on this one:&mdash;</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/g061.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 200px; height: 337px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 200px;'>
Louis XIV.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>On a heavy pedestal, in the chamber of Mother
Michel, was a marble bust of Louis XIV., represented
with a Roman helmet and a
peruke interlaced with laurel-leaves.
Behind this bust was
a round window, which looked
upon the staircase; and just in
front of the pedestal was the
downy cushion that served as
a bed for Moumouth, who
would certainly have been
crushed if the bust had taken
it into its head to topple over.</p>
<p>One night Lustucru stole
noiselessly into the chamber of
Mother Michel, opened the
round window, which he was careful to leave ajar,
and retired silently. At midnight, when everybody
was asleep in the house, he took one of those
long brooms, commonly called a wolf-head, placed himself
on the staircase opposite the small window, rested his
back firmly against the banister, and, with the aid
of the wolf-head, pushed over the bust, which tumbled
with a loud crash on the cushion beneath.</p>

Downfall of Louis XIV.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The wicked man had expected this result of his
movement; it was for him the signal
of his triumph and the death of Moumouth.
However, when he heard
the bust roll heavily on
the floor, he was seized
by a panic, and, with
trembling steps, regained
his chamber.
Mother Michel
awoke with a
start; she was
in complete
darkness, and
unable to procure a light, for German chemical
matches were not yet invented.
Surprise and fright had taken away
her faculties for an instant, then she
cried, "Stop thief!" with all the
strength of her lungs. Very soon
the whole house was roused, and
all the servants came running in to
learn what was the matter.</p>

</p>

<p>Lustucru appeared last, with a
cotton night-cap on his head, and, for the rest, very
simply clad.</p>
<p>"What has happened?" he demanded.</p>
<p>"I see now," answered Mother Michel; "it is the
bust of Louis XIV. that has fallen down."</p>
<p>"Bah!" said Father Lustucru, playing astonishment.
"But, in that case, your cat must have received
it on his head."</p>
<p>As he said these words, Moumouth came out from
under the bed
and threw himself
before
Mother Michel,
as if to implore
her aid and protection.
Lustucru
stood amazed.</p>

Moumouth comes forth.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Everybody
knows how light
is the slumber of cats. Moumouth, who had the
habit of sleeping with only one eye, had risen quickly
on hearing a rustling behind the round window.
Like nearly all animals, he was curious, and sought
to understand anything that astonished him; so he
camped himself in the middle of the chamber, the
better to observe with what intention the wolf-head
advanced at that unseasonable hour by so unusual a
route. Startled by the fall of the bust, he had fled
for refuge to the bottom of the alcove.</p>
<p>They gave Mother Michel, to revive her, a glass of
sugar and water, flavored with orange-flower; they
picked up the great king, who had smashed his nose
and chin, and lost half of his beautiful peruke;
then everybody went to bed once more.</p>
<p>"Saved again!" said Father Lustucru to himself.
"He always escapes me! I shall not be able, then,
to send him to his fathers before the return of the
Countess! Mother Michel will get her pension of
fifteen hundred livres, and I shall remain a nobody,
the same as before. That rascally cat distrusts me;
everything I undertake alone against him fails....
Decidedly, I must get somebody to help me!"</p>

<h3>HOW FATHER LUSTUCRU CONFIDES HIS ODIOUS PLANS<br />TO NICHOLAS FARIBOLE.</h3>

<p>ather
Lustucru searched
for an accomplice. He at first
thought of finding one among
the domestics of the household;
but he reflected that they all
were devoted to Mother Michel,
and were capable of betraying
him, and causing him to be
shamefully turned out of the mansion, in which he
held so honorable and lucrative a post. However, he
had great desire for an accomplice. In what class,
of what age and sex, and on what terms should he
select one?</p>
<p>Occupied with these thoughts, Lustucru went out
one morning at about half-past six, to take a walk on
the quay. As he crossed the threshold, he noticed
on the other side of the street a large woman, dry
and angular, clothed in cheap, flashy colors. This
woman had sunken eyes, a copper-colored complexion,
the nose of a bird of prey, and a face as wrinkled
as an old apple. She was talking with a boy of thirteen
or fourteen, covered with rags, but possessing a
sharp, intelligent countenance.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

The old Woman and the Boy.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Father Lustucru thought he recognized the old
woman, but without recalling
where he had seen her. If he
had been less occupied he would
have searched longer
into his memory; but
the idea of making
away with the cat absorbed
him entirely,
and he continued
his route with a
thoughtful air,
his head bent
forward, his
arms crossed
upon his breast,
and his eyes
fixed upon the
ground, as if
the accomplice
he wanted might possibly spring up out of the
earth.</p>
<p>Thus he wandered for some time; the breeze of
the morning failed to cool his blood, heated with evil
passions. Neither the spectacle of the pure skies,
nor the songs of the birds, who enjoyed themselves
on the border of the river, awoke in him those calm
and sweet emotions with which
they inspire honest people.</p>

Lustucru is absorbed.<br />
</p>

<p>At the moment when he returned,
the old woman was no
longer to be seen; but the boy
remained in the same place,
seated upon a stone post, with
his nose in the air, regarding the
mansion of Madame de la Grenouillère
very attentively. Lustucru
approached him and addressed
him in these terms:&mdash;</p>
<p>"What are you doing there,
youngster?"</p>
<p>"I? Nothing. I am looking
at that mansion."</p>
<p>"I believe that without difficulty;
but why do you look at
it?"</p>
<p>"Because I find it handsome,
and would like to live in it; one
ought to be happy there."</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed," answered the
steward, with emphasis; "they
pass the days there happily
enough. Who is that woman with whom you were
speaking a while since?"</p>
<p>"It was Madame Bradamor."</p>

who lives below, at the other end of the street?"</p>
<p>"The same."</p>
<p>"You know her?"</p>
<p>"A little; I sometimes do errands for her."</p>
<p>"Ah, ah!... And what did the old wizard say
to you?"</p>
<p>"She said that if I could enter that house as a
domestic, I should have a very agreeable existence."</p>
<p>"Madame de la Grenouillère is absent, my little
friend, and, besides, her house is full."</p>
<p>"That is a pity," said the boy, drawing a deep
sigh.</p>
<p>Father Lustucru made several steps as if to re-enter,
rested his hand upon the knocker of the door,
then turned abruptly and walked up to the boy.</p>
<p>"What is your name?"</p>
<p>"Nicholas Langlumé, the same as my father&#8217;s;
but I am more generally known under the nickname
of Faribole."</p>
<p>"What do you do?"</p>
<p>"Nothing; my father works on the quay, and I,&mdash;I
live from day to day, gaining my bread as I can.
I run errands, I sell May-bugs and black-birds and
sparrows, I pick up nails in the gutters and sell them,
I open the doors of carriages, I fish for logs in the
Seine, I sing verses in the streets, I light lamps, and
sometimes I play in the pantomimes at the theatre of
Nicolet. These trades, sir, are not worth much; and
I have all I can do to get something to eat every
day."</p>
<p>"You interest me," replied Father Lustucru, "and
I&#8217;ve a wish to help you on in the world. Tell me,
Faribole, have you a taste for cooking?"</p>
<p>"Rather! I love the tid-bits, but my means do
not allow me"&mdash;</p>
<p>"I did not ask you if you were fond of eating,
stupid! I asked you if you had the taste, the inclination,
to do cooking."</p>
<p>"I don&#8217;t know; I never tried."</p>

The Steward engages Faribole.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>"Well, then, Faribole, I will give you lessons.
Come, follow me; I will clothe you
and take care of you at my own expense,
in awaiting
the arrival of Madame
de la Grenouillère.
She is a good
lady, and will doubtless
retain you; but
if she does not, your
education will be
commenced, and
you&#8217;ll be able to place yourself elsewhere."</p>
<p>"You are, then, in the service of the Countess?"</p>
<p>"I am her steward," said Father Lustucru, with
dignity.</p>
<p>The eyes of Faribole sparkled with pleasure; he
bowed respectfully before the steward, and said with
warmth:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Ah, how much I owe to you!"</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

A little awkward at first.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Faribole was installed that same day, and cordially
received by the other servants of the household. He
was a good-natured boy, serviceable
and quick, and, although
a little awkward in his
new clothes and at his new
duties, he showed plenty of
willingness.</p>
<p>"Faribole," said the steward
to his protégé, several
days afterward, "It is well to
let you know the ways of the
house. There is an individual here, all-powerful,
who reigns as sovereign master, whose will is obeyed,
whose whims are anticipated,&mdash;and that individual
is a cat. If you wish to make your way in the
world, it is necessary to seek to please Moumouth;
if the cat Moumouth accords you his affections, you
will also have that of Madame de la Grenouillère and
her companion, Mother Michel."</p>

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 200px;'>
The Cat and the Boy become Friends.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>"The cat shall be my friend,
and I will be the friend of the
cat," responded the young fellow, confidently.</p>
<p>In effect, he showered on Moumouth
so many kindnesses and
caresses and attentions, that the cat, although naturally
suspicious, conceived a lively attachment for
Faribole, followed him with pleasure, teased him, and
invited him to frolics. Mother Michel was nearly
jealous of the small boy; Father Lustucru, who had
ideas of his own, laughed in his sleeve, and rubbed
his hands together.</p>
<p>The steward, one evening, ordered Faribole to
come to his chamber, and after closing the door carefully
and assuring himself that no one was listening,
he said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Moumouth is your friend; you have followed
my recommendations exactly."</p>
<p>"I shall remain in the house&mdash;is it not so?"</p>
<p>"Probably. You find yourself very well here?"</p>
<p>"Without doubt! I, who lived on black bread, I
make four good meals a day. I had a wretched
blouse, full of holes, and patched trousers, and now
I am dressed like a prince. I suffer no more from
cold, and, instead of lying out under the stars, I go
to sleep every night in a comfortable bed, where I
dream of gingerbread and fruit-cake."</p>
<p>Father Lustucru rested his chin on the palm of
his right hand, and fixing his piercing eyes upon
Faribole, said to him:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Suppose you were obliged to take up again with
the vagabond life from which I lifted you?"</p>
<p>"I believe I should die with shame!"</p>
<p>"Then you would do anything to preserve your
present position?"</p>
<p>"I would do anything."</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/g073.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 300px; height: 197px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 300px;'>
Lustucru and Faribole.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>"Anything?"</p>
<p>"Anything, absolutely."</p>
<p>"Very well. Now, this is what I demand of you
imperatively:
Moumouth follows
you willingly;
to-morrow,
just at
night-fall, you
will lead him
into the garden;
you will put him into a
sack which I have made expressly, and tightly draw
the cords of the sack"&mdash;</p>
<p>"And then?" said Faribole, who opened his eyes
wide.</p>
<p>"We will each arm us with a stick, and we will
beat upon the sack until he is dead."</p>
<p>"Never! never!" cried the poor boy, whose hair
stood up with fright.</p>
<p>"Then pack your bundle quickly, and be off; I
turn you away!"</p>
<p>"You turn me away!" repeated young Faribole,
lifting up his hands to the sky.</p>
<p>"I do not give you five minutes to be gone; you
depend upon me here, solely on me."</p>
<p>The unhappy Faribole began to weep, and the
steward added, in a savage voice,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Come, now! no faces! Take off your clothes,
and put on your rags, and disappear!"</p>
<p>Having pronounced these words, Lustucru took
from a closet the miserable vestments which Faribole
had worn the day of his installation. The steward
seized them disdainfully between his thumb and forefinger,
and threw them
upon the floor.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 300px;'>
Faribole&#8217;s Old Clothes.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The boy looked with
an air of despair
at the habits he had
on, compared
them with
those which
he was obliged
to resume, and
the comparison
was so little to the advantage of the latter, that
he broke into loud sobs.</p>
<p>However, he was decided not to purchase handsome
clothes at the price of a perfidy and a horrible
murder. He resolutely threw off his vest, then his
neckerchief; but at the idea of giving up his new
shoes, of walking barefoot, as formerly, over roads
paved with gravel and broken glass, the luckless
Faribole had a moment of hesitation.</p>
<p>Father Lustucru, who observed him closely, profited
by this circumstance with consummate cunning.</p>
<p>"Foolish fellow!" said he; "you refuse happiness
when it would be so easy for you to retain it. If I
proposed to you the death of a man, I could understand,
I could even approve of your scruples; but I
propose that of a cat&mdash;a simple cat! What do you
find in that so terrible? What is a cat? Nothing&mdash;less
than nothing; one doesn&#8217;t attach the least value
to the lives of cats. Inn-keepers give them to their
customers to eat; the most celebrated surgeons massacre
them in making certain experiments. Cats are
thought so little of, that when a
litter of six or seven are born,
only one is kept; the rest are
tossed into the river."</p>

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 200px;'>
"Only one is kept; the rest are tossed into the River."<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>"But Moumouth is large,
Moumouth is fully grown," said
Faribole in a plaintive tone;
"and then, you do not know, I
love him."</p>
<p>"You love him! you dare to
love him!" cried the steward
with inexpressible rage. "Very well! I&mdash;I detest
him, and I wish his death!"</p>
<p>"But what has he done to you, then?"</p>
<p>"What business is that to you? I desire his
death, and that&#8217;s enough."</p>
<p>"Mercy for him!" cried Faribole, throwing himself
at the feet of hard-hearted Lustucru.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/g076.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 250px; height: 347px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 250px;'>
"Get up! Depart!"<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>"No mercy!" replied Lustucru, hissing the words
through his clenched teeth. "No mercy, neither for
him nor for you. Get up, depart,
be off this very instant!
It rains in torrents; you will
be drenched, you will die of
cold this night,&mdash;so much the
better!"</p>
<p>A beating rain, mixed with
hailstones, pattered against the
window-panes, and the wind
swept with a mournful sound
through the halls of the house.
Then poor Faribole thought of the cold that would
seize him, of the privations which awaited him, of his
few resources, of his immense appetite, and how disagreeable
it was to sleep on the damp earth. His
evil genius took possession of him, and whispered
into his ear these words of Father Lustucru: "What
is a cat?"</p>
<p>"Monsieur Lustucru," said he, weeping, "do not
send me away, I will do all that you wish."</p>
<p>"To-morrow, at night-fall, you will lead Moumouth
into the garden?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Monsieur Lustucru."</p>
<p>"You will put him into this sack?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Monsieur Lustucru."</p>
<p>"And you will beat it with me?"</p>
<p>The response to this question was long coming;
Faribole turned pale, his legs bent under him; finally
he bowed his head, letting his arms droop at his sides,
as if he had sunk under the weight of his destiny,
and murmured, in a stifled voice:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Yes, Monsieur Lustucru."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h3>IN WHICH FATHER LUSTUCRU IS ON THE POINT OF<br />ACCOMPLISHING HIS PURPOSE, AND MOTHER MICHEL&#8217;S<br />CAT IS IN AN UNPLEASANT PREDICAMENT.</h3>
</div>

<div class='figleft'>
<img src='images/g077.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 150px; height: 153px;' /><br />
</div>

<p>ustucru
had fixed the following
day for the cruel execution of
Moumouth, for he knew that
Mother Michel on that day was
to carry to the express office
a package destined for her sister.</p>
<p>All the forenoon and afternoon
Faribole was plunged in the darkest despondency,
and when the fatal hour sounded, he was assailed
by the irresolutions of the previous day.
When Mother Michel, before going out, said to him,
"I leave Moumouth in your charge; you must take
care of him, and make him play, so that he will not
fret too much during my absence," the poor lad felt
his heart fail, and his natural loyalty revolted.</p>
<p>"Come, we have not a minute to lose," said Father
Lustucru to Faribole; "here is the sack; go look for
the beast!"</p>
<p>Faribole once more appealed to the pity of the
steward; he was eloquent, he had tears in his voice,
he pronounced a most touching plea, but without being
able to gain his cause. The executioner was immovable;
he insisted on the death of the cat; and
the boy, overpowered by this evil spirit, saw himself
forced to obey.</p>
<p>Moumouth allowed himself to be enticed into the
garden; he followed his treacherous friend with the
confidence of the lamb following the butcher, and, at
the very moment when he least thought of it, he
found himself fastened in the sack that was to be his
tomb. Lustucru, who was hiding, appeared suddenly,
bearing two enormous cudgels; he handed one to his
accomplice, and taking hold of the sack, cried:&mdash;"Now!&mdash;to
work, and no quarter!"</p>
<p>Faribole heard him not; the boy was struck with
stupor&mdash;his eyes rolled wildly in their sockets, his
face was livid, his mouth open, his arms without
strength.</p>
<p>Father Lustucru, animated by the nearness of his
vengeance, did not remark what passed in the mind
of his companion. Having thrown the sack rudely on
the ground, the steward lifted his cudgel, and was
about to strike when the small door of the garden opened.</p>
<p>"How unfortunate!" he muttered; "Faribole,
hide yourself in the hedge; I will come back here
presently."</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/g078.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 500px; height: 393px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 500px;'>
The Steward lifted his Cudgel.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>He approached the person who had entered, and
halted, petrified with amazement, on beholding
Mother Michel. He imagined at first that she had
been brought back by some vague suspicion, by
some presentiment; but he recovered himself, hearing her
say:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I am obliged to postpone my walk, for I have
seen Madame de la Grenouillère&#8217;s carriage coming;
it turned out of its way on account
of the repairs being made in the street.
By reentering through the
garden I was able to get
here in advance.
Come, Monsieur
Lustucru,
let us hasten to
receive our
good mistress."</p>
<p>"I am with
you, madame,"
said the steward;
then, making
a speaking-trumpet of his hand, he cried to
Faribole:&mdash;</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/g079.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 300px; height: 266px;' /><br />

Making a Speaking-trumpet of his Hand.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>"Strike all alone! strike until the cat has ceased
to move!" and he rejoined Mother Michel in the
court, where the domestics were drawn up in a line
like a well-drilled battalion.</p>
<p>On stepping from the carriage Madame de la Grenouillère
honored her servitors with a benevolent
glance, embraced Mother Michel with touching familiarity,
and demanded news
of Moumouth.</p>

The Countess embraces Mother Michel.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>"Your protégé
is wonderfully
well," said
Mother Michel,
"he grows fatter
and handsomer
under our
very eyes; but
it may be said,
without injury
to the truth,
that his moral qualities are even beyond his physical
charms."</p>
<p>"Poor friend, if he does not love me he will be a
monster of ingratitude, for since our separation I
have thought of him constantly; Heaven has taken
away many beings that were dear to me, but Moumouth
will be the consolation of my old age!"</p>
<p>As soon as the Countess had given the orders which
her arrival made necessary, she prayed Mother Michel
to fetch Moumouth.</p>
<p>"He will be charmed to see you again, madame,"
Mother Michel answered; "he is in the garden in
the care of Faribole, a little young man whom your
steward judged proper to admit to the house; the
young rogue and the cat have become a pair of intimate
friends."</p>

Faribole seated in the Garden.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Mother Michel went down to the garden and there
found Faribole alone, seated
upon a bench, and with a preoccupied
air stripping the
leaves from a branch of boxwood
which he held in his
hand.</p>
<p>"My friend," said the good
woman, "Madame, the Countess,
desires you to bring Moumouth to her."</p>
<p>"Moumouth!" stammered Faribole, starting at
the name as if he had been stung by a wasp.</p>
<p>"Yes, Moumouth; I thought he was with you."</p>
<p>"He just quitted me; some persons passing in the
street made a noise that frightened him, and he
leaped into the hedge."</p>
<p>Mother Michel, after having spent more than half
an hour in scouring the garden, returned to Madame
de la Grenouillère and said: "Moumouth is absent,
madame; but do not be anxious; he disappeared once
before, and we found him in the garret."</p>
<p>"Let him be searched for! I do not wish to wait.
I desire to see him this instant!"</p>
<p>Alas! this desire was not likely to be gratified, if
any reliance could be placed upon the words exchanged
in the dark between Lustucru and his accomplice.</p>
<p>"Well, did you do it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Monsieur Lustucru, I pounded until the cat
ceased to move."</p>
<p>"What have you done with the body?"</p>
<p>"I have thrown it into the Seine."</p>
<p>"Was he quite dead?"</p>
<p>"He didn&#8217;t stir."</p>
<p>"Anyway, the sack was securely fastened. Justice
is done!"</p>

<h3>IN WHICH MOTHER MICHEL SEARCHES FOR HER CAT.</h3>
</div>

<div class='figleft'>
<img src='images/g082.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 150px; height: 179px;' /><br />
</div>

<p>everal
days passed in painful
expectation; but the cat, like
General Marlborough, did not
come back. The despair of
Madame de la Grenouillère was
sincere, profound, and silent,&mdash;all
the more intense because it
was suppressed. She continually
pictured to herself the
charming ways of Moumouth, his natural goodness,
his superior intelligence. No animal had ever displayed
to her so many brilliant qualities; not one of
her previous favorites had ever caused her such bitter
regrets.</p>
<p>Generous in her misfortune, she did not reproach
Mother Michel; on the contrary, the Countess sought
to comfort that poor woman, who had given herself
up wholly to grief. The Countess said to her one
night:&mdash;</p>
<p>"What can you do against an irresistible calamity?
The wisdom of man consists not in struggling with
unhappiness, but in submitting himself to the will of
Heaven."</p>
<p>"I am of your opinion," replied Mother Michel.
"If I believed, like you, in the death of Moumouth,
I would resign myself without a murmur. But I
have the idea that he still lives; I picture him running
through the streets, the victim of ill treatment,
with saucepans, may be"&mdash;</p>
<p>"Go to, Mother Michel, you deceive yourself;
Moumouth is dead, otherwise he would have come
back to us."</p>
<p>"Something tells me that he is still in this world,
and if Madame the Countess wishes to have tidings of
him, she has only to address herself"&mdash;</p>
<p>"To whom?"</p>
<p>"To our neighbor, Madame Bradamor, that celebrated
fortune-teller, who predicts the future, removes
freckles, reads in the Book of Destinies, and charms
away the toothache."</p>
<p>"Fie, Mother Michel! how can you, a sensible
woman, have any confidence in the juggling of an
adventuress?"</p>
<p>"But, madame, I am not alone; the most distinguished
people go to Madame Bradamor; she is more
learned and less dear than her rivals, and asks only
ten crowns to make you behold the devil Astaroth."</p>
<p>"Enough, for pity&#8217;s sake!" responded the Countess,
dryly.</p>
<p>Mother Michel remained silent; but she had made
up her mind, and, the first time she had a moment
of liberty, she ran to the house of the necromancer.</p>
<p>The fortune-teller occupied a spacious apartment
richly furnished, for she gained a great deal of money
by cheating the public. Her consultation-room was
draped with hangings of black velvet sprinkled with
gilt stars; upon a square table, in the centre of the
chamber, stood painted tin obelisks, jars of electricity,
retorts, and divers mathematical instruments, of
whose uses the pretended sorceress was quite ignorant,
but which she had placed there in order to
impose on the weak-minded persons who came to
consult her.</p>
<p>She at first showed some embarrassment on beholding
Mother Michel; however, after having closed
a glass door which communicated with the other
apartments, she returned to salute her new client,
and said in a solemn tone:&mdash;</p>
<p>"What is your desire?"</p>
<p>"To question the present, the past, and the
future."</p>
<p>"I am the very one to satisfy you," replied Madame
Bradamor; "but what you demand is very difficult,
and will cost you three crowns."</p>
<p>"There they are; I give them to you with all my
heart."</p>
<p>Madame Bradamor, full of regret that she had not
insisted on having more, pocketed the money, and
began in these terms:&mdash;</p>
<p>"What is the date of your birth?"</p>
<p>"The 24th of May, 1698."</p>
<p>"What are the initials of your name and the first
letter of the place in which you were born?"</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

Mother Michel pays Three Crowns.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>"A, R, M, N, L, S."</p>
<p>Madame Michel was named Anastasie Ravegot;
the widow, since twelve years, of François Michel, in
life inspector of butter in the Paris markets; she
was born in Noisy-le-Sec.</p>
<p>"What is your favorite flower?"</p>
<p>"The Jerusalem artichoke."</p>
<p>After these customary questions, the fortune-teller
examined some coffee-grounds poured into a saucer,
and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Phaldarus, the genie of things unknown, informs
me that you are in search of a being very dear to
you."</p>
<p>Mother Michel bounded in her chair with surprise.</p>
<p>Madame Bradamor continued: "This being is not a
man; it is a quadruped&mdash;either a dog or a cat.
Ariel, spirit celestial, reveals to me that it is a cat."</p>
<p>Mother Michel was more and more impressed;
without giving her time to recover herself, the fortune-teller
took a pack of cards, shuffled them, cut
them three times, then disposed them in a systematic
order on the table, and said gravely:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Your cat is the knave of clubs; let us see what
happens to him. One, two, three, four; ten of
spades! He is a wanderer, he has a passion for
travel, he sets out at night to see the curiosities of
Paris. One, two, three, four; the queen of spades!
It is a woman who manufactures ermine fur out of
cat-skin. One, two, three, four; the knave of spades!
It is a rag-picker. One, two, three, four; the king
of spades! It is a restaurant-keeper. The falling
together of these three persons alarms me. One,
two, three, four,&mdash;clubs! One, two, three, four,&mdash;clubs
again! One, two, three, four,&mdash;always clubs.
Your cat would bring money to these three persons:
the rag-picker wishes to kill him in order to sell the
skin to the furrier, and the body to the restaurant-keeper,
who will serve it up to his customers
as stewed rabbit. Will the cat be able to resist his
persecutors. One, two, three, four; seven of spades!
It is all over, madame; your cat no longer exists!"</p>

<p>"They have eaten him, the cannibals!" cried
Mother Michel, sinking back, and she fancied she
heard a plaintive <i>miau</i>, the last agonized cry of Moumouth.
But it was not an illusion; a cat had
miaued, and was still miauing in the next chamber.
Suddenly a pane of glass in the door described was
shivered to atoms, and Moumouth in person tumbled

Moumouth appears.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>From the top of a wardrobe he had perceived his
affectionate guardian; he had called to her several
times, and as
she did not answer
him, he had thrown
himself, in his
desperation, against the
glass door,
through which
he had broken
a passage.</p>
<p>"My cat was
with you!"
said Mother Michel; "you have stolen him! My
mistress is powerful; my mistress is the Countess
Yolande de la Grenouillère; she will have you chastised
as you deserve to be!"</p>
<p>While making these threats Mother Michel placed
Moumouth under her arm, and prepared to depart.
Madame Bradamor stopped her, saying:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Do not ruin me, I conjure you! I have not
stolen your cat!"</p>
<p>"How is it in your house, then?"</p>
<p>"I have it from a little boy named Faribole; he
got this cat for me, which I have long desired to
have, on account of his supernatural shape and appearance,
to figure in my cabalistic conjurations.
This is the truth, the whole truth. I beg of you that
your mistress will not disturb me."</p>

"Do not ruin me, I conjure you!"<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>"Madame the Countess will act as she thinks
proper," responded Mother Michel, haughtily; and
she vanished with her cat.</p>
<p>She made but one step from the house of Madame
Bradamor to that of Madame de la Grenouillère; one
would have said that Mother Michel had on the
seven-league boots of little Tom Thumb. She did
not linger in the parlor, when she arrived out of
breath and unable to speak a word, but carried Moumouth
straight to the Countess.</p>
<p>On recognizing the animal, the Countess gave so
loud a cry of joy that it was heard as far as the Place
de la Carrousel.</p>
<p>Lustucru assisted at this touching scene. At the
sight of the cat he was so dumbfounded that his
reason wavered for a moment. He imagined that
the cat, so many times saved, was a fantastic being,
capable of speaking, like the beasts in the fairy-tales,
and he said to himself with a shiver: "I am lost!
Moumouth is going to denounce me!"</p>

soon as Madame de la Grenouillère
learned how Moumouth had been
recovered, she ordered young Faribole
to be brought before her.</p>
<p>"I&#8217;ll go and look him up," said
Father Lustucru, with alacrity.
He was very anxious to warn his accomplice, and
sought an excuse to steal off.</p>
<p>"No, remain! You have admitted him to the
mansion, you shall see him turned away, and will
learn to bestow your confidence more wisely in
future."</p>
<p>Lustucru remained, and, recovering from his first
stupor, resolved to boldly deny everything, if Faribole
should dare to accuse him.</p>
<p>Introduced into the parlor, Faribole did not wait
to be interrogated.</p>

Faribole Explains.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>"Madame the Countess," said he, "the presence
of your cat tells me why you have called me; but
I am less guilty than I appear; permit me to explain."</p>
<p>"It is useless," replied Madame de la Grenouillère;
"your justification is impossible."</p>
<p>The steward, believing it best to play a bold
game, said with irony:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I am curious to know what unlikely story this
rogue has to tell," and in accenting these words
slowly he gave Faribole a glance which signified:
"If you accuse me, woe to you!&#8217;"</p>
<p>Without allowing himself to be confused, Faribole
commenced in these terms:&mdash;</p>
<p>"It is necessary to avow it, madame; I entered
into your service with the intention of stealing your
cat; the fortune-teller wished to have him, to make
him play the part of the devil Astaroth; and she had
seduced me by the promise of a crown of six livres
and a pair of shoes. They treated me so well, and
Moumouth appeared to me so charming, that I renounced
my wicked plans; I never, no, never would
have put them into execution, if I had not found it
was necessary to get Moumouth out of the way in
order to rescue him from the attacks of an enemy all
the more terrible because he was hidden."</p>
<p>"Of whom does he wish to speak?" demanded
Lustucru.</p>
<p>"Of you! of you who have said to me, &#8217;Kill Moumouth,
or I chase you from the house!&#8217;"</p>
<p>"I, I have said that! what an impudent falsehood!
Ah, Madame the Countess, you know me well enough
not to hesitate between the declarations of this fellow
and my flat denial."</p>
<p>"Faribole," said the Countess severely, "your
charge is grave; can you bring any proof to support
it?"</p>
<p>"Proof, alas! no, madame; but I am ready to
swear to you"&mdash;</p>
<p>"Enough," interrupted the Countess; "do not
add calumny to the theft of the cat, but deliver me
of your presence."</p>

Faribole is treated Roughly on the Staircase.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The miserable Faribole wished to protest, but at a
sign from Madame de la Grenouillère, Lustucru seized
him by the arm, led him through
the door without further ceremony,
and treated him in so
rough a manner on the staircase
as to quite relieve him of
any idea of asking for his personal
effects.</p>
<p>However, the iniquities of
the steward were not to remain
long unpunished; that same
day, Mother Michel, in arranging
the closet in the antechamber, was very much
astonished at finding the bodies of several dead rats
and mice; she was wondering what had caused their
death, when she recognized the famous hash that the
cat had refused to eat, and which had been left there
by mistake. Two mice were dead in the plate itself,
so powerful and subtile was the poison!</p>
<p>This discovery tore away the veil which covered
the past of Lustucru. Mother Michel, divining that
the charges of Faribole were well founded, hastened
to inform Madame de la Grenouillère, who recommended
her to keep silent, and sent for the steward.</p>
<p>"Have you still the &#8217;Death to Rats?&#8217;" she asked
him.</p>
<p>"Yes, madame, I think I have a little left."</p>
<p>"Some should be placed in the antechamber; you
have not thought of that before?"</p>
<p>"Never, madame; I did not know there were rats
in that part of the house."</p>
<p>"Very well; you can retire."</p>

A Celebrated Chemist analyzes the Hash.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Madame de la Grenouillère wrote to a celebrated
chemist, who, after having analyzed
the hash, declared that it
contained a prodigious quantity
of poison.</p>
<p>The crime of Lustucru was
then evident; but other proofs
were not long in rising against
him. The adventure of Groquemouche
and Guignolet was talked about among the
boatmen; Faribole heard the story from one of them,
and discovered a person who had seen Lustucru
throw Moumouth from the bridge of Notre Dame.</p>

The Fate of the Steward.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The steward, confounded, did not wait to be discharged;
he fled, and, to escape the vengeance of
Madame de la Grenouillère, embarked as cook on
board of a merchant vessel bound for Oceanica.</p>
<p>It was afterward learned that this ship had been
wrecked upon the Sandwich Islands, and that the
savages had eaten Lustucru.
History records that at the
moment of expiring he pronounced
but a single word,
the name of Moumouth!</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>What was it that brought
this name to the lips of the
guilty man? Was it remorse? or was it the last explosion
of an unforgiving hatred? This is what history
has neglected to inform us.</p>
<p>The health of Madame de la Grenouillère had been
altered by the heavy shocks she had experienced in
losing her favorite animals. The tenderness and
graces of Moumouth would perhaps have been sufficient
to attach her to life; but the respectable lady
had reached an age when sorrows press very heavily.
Mother Michel had the grief, one morning, to find
the Countess dead in her bed; her face was so calm
and bore so plainly the impress of all her lovable
qualities, that one would have believed she slept.
She was nearly in her seventy-ninth year.</p>
<p>By her will, which she had deposited with her
lawyer, she had left to Moumouth and Mother Michel
an income of two thousand livres, to revert, in case
of the death of either, to the survivor.</p>
<p>Mother Michel took up her residence near her
sister, provided handsomely for all the children, and
selected for her own retreat a pretty cottage situated
in Low-Breton upon the banks of the river among
the green trees.</p>

<p>Faribole, received
again into the service
of Madame de la
Grenouillère, conducted
himself so
well that his transient
error was forgotten.
He would
have been able to distinguish himself in the kitchen,
but he preferred to serve the State, and enlisted at
the age of sixteen in an infantry regiment. He took
part in the expedition against Majorca under the
command of Marshal Richelieu, and was named corporal
after the capture of Port-Mahon, June the 29th,
1756. When he obtained his discharge, he returned
to live near Mother Michel, for whom he had an
affection truly filial. To the agitations of their existence
succeeded calm and happy days, embellished by
the constantly increasing graces of Moumouth.</p>
<p>Our cat henceforth was without an enemy; he
won, on the contrary, the esteem and affection of all
who knew him. His adventures had made him quite
famous. Besides the ballad,&mdash;of which, unfortunately,
only two couplets have been preserved,&mdash;the
poets of the period wrote in his honor a large
number of verses that have not come down to us.
He received visits from the most distinguished men
of the time, even from the King himself, who once,
on his way to the Chateau of Bellevue, dropped in
for a moment on Moumouth.</p>
<p>A grand lady of the court condescended to choose
for Moumouth a very gentle and very pretty companion,
whom he accepted with gratitude. In seeing
himself a father Moumouth&#8217;s happiness was at
its highest, as was also that of Mother Michel, who
felt that she lived again in the posterity of her cat.</p>
<p>You wish to know what finally became of Moumouth?
He died,&mdash;but it was not until after a long
and joyous career. His eyes, in closing, looked with
sweet satisfaction upon groups of weeping children
and grandchildren. His mortal remains were not
treated like those of ordinary cats. Mother Michel
had built for him a magnificent mausoleum of white
marble. Following a custom then adopted at the
burial of all illustrious personages, they engraved
upon the tomb of Moumouth an epitaph in Latin,
composed by a learned professor of the University
of Paris.</p>
